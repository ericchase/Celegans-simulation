# Celegans-simulation
A terrible port to Windows under Visual Studio 2017

Someone on Reddit asked for a port, and I was up for the challenge. <br>
The original Celegans-simulation code belongs to Carlo Meroni.
The patch work I offer is up for grabs.

I'd be happy to answer any questions related to this port.

# From original readme:
To 'turn on' the worm, hold the F key for few seconds.

You can control the simulation with the keyboard:
<br> S = show brain and muscle data
<br> F = give food to the worm
<br> N = touch the worm nose
<br> A = touch anterior
<br> P = touch posterior
<br> Q = quit

<br><br>
### Note from the editor:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try out 'S' <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's pretty cool
