# Celegans-simulation
A terrible port to Windows under Visual Studio 2017

Someone on Reddit asked for a port, and I was up for the challenge. <br>
The code here is not mine, and the patch work is up for grabs.

I'd be happy to answer any questions related to the port, ask away.

# From original readme:
To 'turn on' the worm, hold the F key for few seconds.

You can control the simulation with the keyboard:
<br> S = show brain and muscle data
<br> F = give food to the worm
<br> N = touch the worm nose
<br> A = touch anterior
<br> P = touch posterior
<br> Q = quit


Note from the editor:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try out 'S'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's pretty cool
