A terrible port to Windows under Visual Studio 2017

Someone on Reddit asked for a port, and I was up for the challenge. <br>
The code here is not mine, and the patch work is up for grabs.

I'd be happy to answer any questions related to the port, ask away.



From original readme:
To 'turn on' the worm, hold the F key for few seconds.

You can control the simulation with the keyboard:
S = show brain and muscle data
F = give food to the worm
N = touch the worm nose
A = touch anterior
P = touch posterior
Q = quit


Note from the editor:
  <br> try out 'S'
  <br> it's pretty cool
